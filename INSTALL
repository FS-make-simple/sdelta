sdelta requires the mhash library 
for generating sha1sum message digest.
mhash is available from
http://mhash.sourceforge.net
sdelta has been tested with mhash version 0.9.1
although newer or older versions may work fine.

Only on FreeBSD is the dlmalloc library required.

Export to the environment desired CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

For Linux and Solaris: $ make
For FreeBSD:           $ make bsd
For All:               $ make install
