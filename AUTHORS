sdelta was inspired by Joshua MacDonald's xdelta algorithm
which was inspired by Andrew Tridgell's and Paul Mackerras's
rsync algorithm.

Original sdelta source code and endian code by Kyle Sallee,
however additional endian/architecture/POSIX 
porting code was added by Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net>
so that sdelta can be run on FreeBSD and Solaris platforms.

input.h and input.c contributed by Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net>

Kyle Sallee also created the Sorcerer distribution of
